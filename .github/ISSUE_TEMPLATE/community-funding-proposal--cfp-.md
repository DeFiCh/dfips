After you have submitted this CFP on Github, head to DeFiScan to generate a command line that will be required to submit your proposal on-chain officially. Instructions will be provided on DeFiScan. Once the command line is generated, copy and paste it on CLI in your full node wallet. 

As part of the requirement of CFP submissions, you are required to pay 1% of the requested fee, or 10 DFI, whichever is larger for it to be voted on. Fees will be automatically deducted when the transaction is made on CLI. Do ensure you have sufficient funds in your full node wallet. 

You are also encouraged to submit a Reddit discussion thread as part of CFP proposals to allow for a more open discussion with the community. Reddit discussion threads however do not require a fee, you can also use this process to sound out the community's acceptance before committing & paying the submission fee.
