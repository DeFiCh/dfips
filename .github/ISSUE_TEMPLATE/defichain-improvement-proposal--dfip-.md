After you have submitted this DFIP on Github, head to DeFiScan and create your command line. Command lines will be required to submit your proposal on-chain officially. Instructions will be provided on DeFiScan. Once the command line is generated, copy and paste it on CLI in your full node wallet. As part of the requirement of DFIP submissions, you are required to pay 50 DFI fee for it to be voted on. Fees will be automatically deducted when the transaction is made on CLI. Do ensure you have sufficient funds. 

Optionally, you are also encouraged to submit a Reddit discussion thread as part of DFIP proposals to allow for a more open discussion with the community. Reddit discussion threads however do not require a fee, you can also use this process to sound out the community's acceptance first before committing to it and paying the fee.
